# An archive of voices, from people with names

I'll be using yarn and grunt for my build front-end pipeline.

## Models
`names` will be the core model of this project. In it, are the names of interviewees, and all their associated files.


## Styles

I will be using sass (via an npm package, installed via yarn) to build out the styles.  
Grids will use Bulma.

## Scripts
